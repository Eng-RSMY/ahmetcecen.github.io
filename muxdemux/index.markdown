[**Zapier**](http://zapier.com/) is a service that facilitates and automates communication between quite a lot of apps. It is an update based service, so it will only work for *future* events. The general structure of a "zap" is as follows: If a **something** happens at **App A**, do **something** at **App B**, *with or without* importing information from **App A**.
